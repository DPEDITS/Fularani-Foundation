## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** v18 or higher
* **npm** or **yarn**
* **MongoDB** connection accessible locally or via Cloud

---

### Installation

Our root `package.json` includes custom scripts to make installation a breeze.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DPEDITS/Fularani-Foundation.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd Fularani-Foundation

# Install everything at once (Root + App + Backend)
npm run install-all
```

---

### Run Development Server

You don't need to open multiple terminals to develop. The root package uses `concurrently` to spin up both projects simultaneously!

```bash
# Start both Frontend and Backend concurrently
npm run dev
```

*(Windows users can also simply double-click `dev.bat` or run `.\dev.bat`)*

Open your browser at:
👉 **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) 

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

You need to establish separate environment configuration files for both the frontend and backend. 

**Frontend (`app/.env`)**
Create an `.env` file in the `app/` directory (use `app/.env.sample` as a reference):
```env
VITE_SITE_URL=https://fularanifoundation.org
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

**Backend (`backend/.env`)**
Create an `.env` file in the `backend/` directory (use `backend/.env.sample` as a reference):
```env
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 🏗️ Build for Production

To build the frontend for production manually:
```bash
cd app
npm run build
npm run preview
```

However, the architecture natively supports automated deployments platforms setting up the build directory via respective platform configurations (e.g. `render.yaml`).
